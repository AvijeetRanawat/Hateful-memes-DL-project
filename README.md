# Meme Classification System

## Introduction
Welcome to our Meme Classification System! This project employs state-of-the-art transformer-based machine learning models for binary classification, determining whether memes are hateful or not. Utilizing a multimodal approach, the system analyzes both textual and visual elements from meme data, providing a comprehensive solution for content moderation.

## Features

### 1. Transformer Models
Our classification system harnesses the power of transformer models, known for their ability to capture contextual information and relationships within data. The use of transformers enhances the understanding of both textual content and visual elements in memes.

### 2. Multimodal Approach
Incorporating both text and image modalities, our system takes a multimodal approach to meme classification. This allows for a more nuanced analysis, capturing the interplay between textual content and visual elements in memes.

### 3. Binary Classification
The system is designed for binary classification, categorizing memes into two classes: hateful or not hateful. This straightforward classification provides a clear indication of the nature of the content.

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation
Users have the option to train and fine-tune the transformer models based on their specific dataset. The system includes evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the models, ensuring accuracy in meme classification.

### 5. MMF Framework by Facebook
Our Meme Classification System leverages the [Facebook's MMF (Multimodal Framework)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mmf) for efficient handling of multimodal data. MMF provides a robust infrastructure for training and evaluating models on tasks involving both text and image modalities.
